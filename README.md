# Sportradar BE Coding Exercise: Event Calendar

This project is a complete backend solution for a sports event calendar, built as part of the Sportradar Coding Academy exercise.
## üöÄ Key Features

* **Event Management:** Full CRUD functionality (Create, Retrieve, Update) for sports events.
* **Dynamic Data Model:** Includes related models for `Sport`, `Team`, `Venue`, `Competition`, and `Stage`.
* **Efficient Queries:** Uses `select_related` in all list/detail views to prevent N+1 query problems.
* **Advanced Form Workflow:** Users can create related models (like `Team` or `Stage`) "on-the-fly" from the "Create Event" page using a `?next=` URL redirect.
* **Filtering & Sorting:** The main event list can be filtered by sport and sorted by date (newest or oldest first).
* **Clean Architecture:** Built using Django's Class-Based Views (ListView, DetailView, CreateView, UpdateView) and ModelForms.
